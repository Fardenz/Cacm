## Info

You can execute all the C++ code with `g++ *.cpp` to compile each file. And `time ./a.out<input.txt>out.txt` for executing the binary generated. I use the time given by my machine to calculate how long it would take in the Online Judge (https://onlinejudge.org/) to execute. The final execution time of each problem is submitted in the commit message.
